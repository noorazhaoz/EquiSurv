# Fairness-Aware Processing Techniques in Survival Analysis: Promoting Equitable Predictions

## Introduction
This project adapts and extends several pre-processing and post-processing approaches from classification and regression contexts to survival analysis. The proposed techniques are model-agnostic, flexible, intuitive, and explainable. The goal of this project is to improve fairness in predictive models.

## Methods and Experimental Studies
We conduct experimental studies using both medical and non-medical datasets to assess whether and to what extent the proposed methods improve fairness. Our work considers the trade-offs among proposed methods in terms of group fairness, individual fairness, and predictive performance.

## Data 
The datasets used for this project fall into two categories: medical and non-medical data. Further information on these datasets can be found in the respective folders.
